👋 Hey there, I’m @ViVeKDEV7104!
👀 Passionate about: Coding, development, and constantly leveling up my tech game.
🌱 Currently mastering: Development and data structures (because algorithms are like mental gym reps, right? 💪).
💻 What I do: Writing clean, efficient code and building projects that solve real-world problems.
🏋️‍♂️ Fun fact: I’m a gym enthusiast — pushing limits in both tech and fitness. Coding sprints by day, bench presses by night. 💻💪
